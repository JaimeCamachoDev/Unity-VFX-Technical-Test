# Unity VFX Technical Test

This repository contains a technical and artistic VFX test for Unity developers.

The goal of this test is to evaluate a junior VFX candidate across four equally weighted pillars:
- Technical understanding
- Artistic execution
- Optimization mindset
- Organization, communication and delivery

The test is designed to reflect real production scenarios in Unity URP.

---

## Scope of the Test

The candidate is asked to create a **single VFX demo** that includes:
- An impact effect
- A water effect
- Custom shaders
- Decals
- A clean demo scene

This single task allows evaluation of all four pillars in a realistic and efficient way.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Each pillar represents **25% of the final score**:
- Technical
- Artistic
- Optimization
- Organization & Communication

---

## Notes

- This is not a speed test. Clarity, intention and decision-making matter more than quantity.
- The final result should be functional, readable and explainable.
